# Implementing-Sorting-Techniques
This is a **Java Program** implementing 3 different sorting techniques and comparing the running time performance of these algorithms against each other.
<br>
– **An O(n^2) sorting algorithm** : Bubble Sort.
– **An O(n log n) sorting algorithm** : Merge Sort.
– **An O(n) sorting algorithm** : Counting Sort.

### Provided a set of 15-20 JUnit tests that test the correctness and efficiency of the
 different implemented parts.
